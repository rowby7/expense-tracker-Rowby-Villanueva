# Week 1 Standup Log

## Date: [Today's Date]

### 📊 Weekly Goal
Set up development environment and plan component architecture for expense tracker.

### ✅ What I Completed
- Set up GitHub repository with professional structure
- Created comprehensive README documentation  
- Wrote first ADR about Tailwind CSS choice
- Configured CodeSpaces environment
- Learned GitHub Copilot best practices

### 🚧 What I'm Working On
- Planning React component hierarchy
- Researching TypeScript best practices for React
- Creating initial wireframes in Figma
- Setting up React project with Vite
- Designing data models for expenses

### 🚫 Blockers
- **Technical:**
