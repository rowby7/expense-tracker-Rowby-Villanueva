- Created comprehensive README documentation  
- Wrote first ADR about Tailwind CSS choice
- Configured CodeSpaces environment
- Learned GitHub Copilot best practices

### 🚧 What I'm Working On
- Planning React component hierarchy
- Researching TypeScript best practices for React
- Creating initial wireframes in Figma
- Setting up React project with Vite
- Designing data models for expenses

### 🚫 Blockers
- **Technical:**
  - Unsure about state management approach (Context vs Redux vs Zustand)
  - Need clarification on TypeScript strict mode settings
  
- **Knowledge Gaps:**
  - How to structure TypeScript types for the project
  - Best practices for organizing React components
  
- **Resources Needed:**
  - Examples of well-structured React+TS projects

### 📚 Learning Goals This Week
1. **Master TypeScript with React**
   - Understand generic components
   - Learn proper typing for events and refs
   - Practice with discriminated unions

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Study compound component patterns
   - Understand composition vs inheritance
   - Learn when to split components

3. **Documentation Habits**
   - Keep README updated as I code
   - Document decisions in ADRs
